            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            The ‘Council of States’ which is also known as Rajya Sabha, a nomenclature that was announced by the chair
            in the House on the 23rd August, 1954 has its own distinctive features. The origin of the second Chamber can
            be traced to the Montague-Chelmsford Report of 1918. The Government of India Act, 1919 provided for the
            creation of a ‘Council of State’ as a second chamber of the then legislature with a restricted franchise
            which actually came into existence in 1921. The Governor-General was the ex-officio President of the then
            Council of State. The Government of India Act, 1935, hardly made any changes in its composition.
            <br><br>
            The Constituent Assembly, which first met on 9 December 1946, also acted as the Central Legislature till
            1950, when it was converted as ‘Provisional Parliament’. During this period, the Central Legislature which
            was known as Constituent Assembly (Legislative) and later Provisional Parliament was unicameral till the
            first elections were held in 1952.
            <br><br>
            Extensive debate took place in the Constituent Assembly regarding the utility or otherwise of a Second
            Chamber in Independent India and ultimately, it was decided to have a bicameral legislature for independent
            India mainly because a federal system was considered to be most feasible form of Government for such a vast
            country with immense diversities. A single directly elected House, in fact, was considered inadequate to
            meet the challenges before free India. A second chamber known as the ‘Council of States’, therefore, was
            created with altogether different composition and method of election from that of the directly elected House
            of the People. It was conceived as another Chamber, with smaller membership than the Lok Sabha (House of the
            People). It was meant to be the federal chamber i.e., a House elected by the elected members of Assemblies
            of the States and two Union Territories in which States were not given equal representation. Apart from the
            elected members, provision was also made for the nomination of twelve members to the House by the President.
            The minimum age of thirty years was fixed for membership as against twenty-five years for the Lower House.
            The element of dignity and prestige was added to the Council of State House by making the Vice-President of
            India ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha who presides over its sittings.
